# shillos.mrc

I made this about 20 odd years ago as a fun Greek-Cypriot dialect fun script with lots of action slaps called Poullou Slaps v.2.0. 
The only changes were made in this file is the URL that it advertises.

# anope.mrc

Anope Services 2.0.9+ as this is originally for the CyIRC Network, that has some additions to the services.
